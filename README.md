# Common

A collection of classes that I find myself using for several web projects that use Spring and JPA.

Includes the following components:
- **Calendar view**, renders events on a calendar.
- **Generic DAO**, a generic DAO for basic entity CRUD operations

## TODO
- Find out how to distribute `.ftl` macros with Maven.
